For di former chapter we gather contract - we fit talk say Solidity code don dey transformed into small small bit of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode.

Now we go put dat code for test blockchain.

1. Click di deploy and run icon so ![deploy & run icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/master/Basics/deploy_to_the_remixvm/images/run.png "deploy & run icon").

2. Go pick one of di Remix VMs from di **Environment** pulldown.

3. Click di deploy button or di transact burton wey dey di view wey don expand.

4. You don deploy your compiled contract give di remix VM - na stimulated blockchain ey dey run inside of your browser window.  Di remix vm dey simple fast test chain.  E no dey realistic unto say you no need approve each transaction.

5. Check di terminal to see di detail of dis deployment transaction.

You fit use remix take deploy oda public EVM chains. To take do dis one you o need connect go anoda Environment like Injected Provider.  Di injected provider dey connec remix go browser wallet like metamask or similar one.  We dey try make we go public network for di end of dis tutorial. But before we go dere, we go cover how we go take interact wit deploye contract function.
