For dis area we fit show u solidity primitive data types how we fit declare dem and dem characteristics.

### di bool

U fit declare data a boolean type by using di keyword 'bool'. Booleans fit either get di value `true` or `false`.

### di uint

We fit use di keyword  `uint` and `uint8` to `uint256` to declare an _unsigned integer type_ (they don’t have a sign, unlike -12, for example). Di Uints dey integers dat are positive or zero and range from 8 bits to 256 bits. Dis type `uint` is the same as `uint256`.

### di int

We fit use di keywords `int` and `int8` to `int256` to declare an integer type. Integers fit dey positive, negative, or zero and range from 8 bits to 256 bits. Di type `int` is di same as `int256`.

### di address

Variables of di type `address` hold a 20-byte value, which is di size of an Ethereum address. They get special kind of Ethereum address, `address payable`, which fit receive ether from di contract.

All these data types have default values, as shown in the contract (line 29).

U fit learn more about dis data type as well _Point number wey dem fix_ _Byte Arrays_, _Strings_ and more for de <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html" target="_blank">Solidity documentation</a>.

Later for de course we go look at data structures like **Mappings**, **Arrays**, **Enums**, and **Structs**.

Ui go watch video tutorials for de data types wey dey primitive</a>.

## ⭐️ Assignment

1. Create a new variable `newAddr` that is a `public` `address` and give it a value that is not the same as the available variable `addr`.
2. Create a `public` variable called `neg` that is a negative number, decide upon the type.
3. Create a new variable, `newU` that has the smallest `uint` size type and the smallest `uint` value and is `public`.

Tip: Look at the other address in the contract or search the internet for an Ethereum address.
