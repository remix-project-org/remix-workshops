For solidity we fit define am as custom data types in di form of _structs_. Structs na collection of variables wey fit join different data types.

### To define structs

We dey use di `struct` keyword nd a name (line 5) take define struct. Inside curly braces, we fit define our struct’s members, wey consist of di variable names nd dia data types.

### To intialize structs

Different ways dey to take initialize a struct.

Positional parameters: We fit provide di name of di struct nd di values of hin members as parameters fr parentheses (line 16).

Key-value mapping: We go provide di name of di struct nd di keys and values as mapping inside curly braces (line 19).

Initialize and update a struct: We go initialize one empty struct first con assign am a new value (line 23) to update hin member.

### To access structs

To access a member of a struct we fit use di dot operator (line 33).

### To update structs

To update a structs’ member too go use di dot operator and assign am a new value (lines 39 and 45).

## ⭐️ Assignment

Create a function `remove` wey go take `uint` as parameter nd go delete a struct member with the given index inside di `todos` mapping.
