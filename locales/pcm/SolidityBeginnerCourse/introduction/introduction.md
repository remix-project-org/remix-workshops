Welcome as you come dis interactive solidity course wey dey for beginners.

For dis first section we go give you short preview of di concepts we go cover for dis course look one example forsmart contract make e show you how you fit relate with dis contract inside di Remix IDE.

Dis contract na counter contract wey get di functionality to fit join commot and go back di state of counter variable.

If we look at di top of di contract we fit see some information about di contract like di license (line 1) di Solidity version (line 2) and di keyword contract wit im name Counter (line 4). We go cover dis concept for di next place about di \*\*Basic Syntax \*\*.

Wit uint public count (line 5) we go declare state variable of di type uint wit di visibility public. We go cover dese concepts for our sections about Variables Primitive Data Types wit Visibility.

We come create get function (line 8) wey dey defined wit di view keyword and go back uint type. Specifically e go return di count variable. Dis contract get two more functions inc (line 13) wit dec (line 18) function wey dey increase or decrease awa count variable.
We go talk about dese concepts for our sections about Functions - Reading wit Writing go State Variable wit Functions - View wit pure.

## Compile and Deploy am through Remix

**GIF** Dey relate wit di contract: <img src="https://github.com/dacadeorg/remixMedia/blob/main/solidity-beginner-course/introduction.gif?raw=true" alt="Compile and deploy contract" width="300"/>

1. We fit compile your Counter contract for di “Solidity compiler” module of di Remix IDE.

2. For di “Deploy & run transactions” module we dey select our contract “Counter” for di contract input field wit click on di “Deploy” button.

3. We expand di token contract functions for di IDE make we test its get, inc, wit dec functions.

## ⭐️ Assignment

All through dis course we go give you homework to take test and consolidate your Knowles wey you just get.

Your first homework na to:

1. Compile di contract.
2. Carry am go di Remix VM.
3. Follow your contact relate. I.
