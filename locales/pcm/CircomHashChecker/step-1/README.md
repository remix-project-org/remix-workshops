For this tutorial, we go explore the **Hash Checker** circuit, Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) application wey dey use Circom and Remix-IDE. The Hash Checker circuit de allow you prove knowledge of some input wey hash reach given value and e no go reveal the Inputs themselves.

### Wetin you go learn

- How you go take generate Hash Checker circuit as you dey use Remix-IDE's workspace template.
- How persin go take understand the Circom code wey dem de use hash and check hash.
- How persin go take perform trusted setup as him de use Groth16.
- To de generate Zero-knowledge proofs.
