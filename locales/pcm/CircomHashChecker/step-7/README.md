## Create proof

1. Go the generated proof section:
    - If you don finish compute the witness, you go expand the generate proof section.

2. Configure Proof Generation:
    - Export Verifier Calldata: start this option if you get plan to check the proof on-chain.

3. Generate the proof:

    - Tap on that generate proof button.
    - Wait make the proof generation finish.

4. View the proof:

    - The proof data go dey displayed for the file explorer.
    - You don try! You don successfully compile the hash checker circuit, still perform trusted setup, compute witness, con still generate proof using remix-ide.
