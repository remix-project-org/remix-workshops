Wetin be circom

Circom na language wey dey created for writing arithmetic circuits wey you fit use for zero knowledge proofs, especially zk-SNARKs. E dey allow developers define complex mathematical circuits wey fit prove knowledge for certain data without showing am.

**Why I go use Remix-IDE for Circom?**

- **Easy to Use:** Remix-IDE dey provide user-friendly interface wey dey simplify d development process.
- **Integrated Tools:** Wit plugins like `circuit-compiler`, you fit compile Circom code, perform trusted setups, compute witnesses, nd generate proofs all of dem fr d same environment.
- **u no need Installation:** As e be web-based IDE, you fit start coding immediately mk u no set up local development environment.

For the next step, we go teach you setting up remix-ide for circom development con help you write your first circuit.
