For dis section of the lesson, we go give you begginer talk on blockchain-based tokens.

Blockchain tokens na new technological building block wey dey created by blockchain technology (like dem websites were for the internet) dat enables a decentralized, ownable internet (web3).

### For start

For de context of web3, tokens mean ownership. Tokens fit represent ownership of anytin: art, reputation, items for video game, shares for company, voting rights, or moni.

De revolutionary innovation of blockchain technologi na say e dey allow data to dey stored outside for way wey no change.
Dis new form of data storage de gree us to keep track of ownership and fit true true get digital items for di first time.

Blockchain Technology dem first do am to keep track of who get bitcoin na decentralized digital money and token wey dey fungible.

### Token wey dey Fungible and non-fungible

Tins like dem money: Bitcoin or one dolla now dey fungible. Fungible means say all assets da di same and e dey interchangeable. Assets like dem art, collectibles, or houses dey non-fungible; dem all dey diffrent and you no fit interchange dem.

We fit divide tokens into two: fungile tokens na where all di tokens an di same and non fungible like dem nfts were all of dem dey unique.

### Di standard of token

De behavior of token dem write am for smart contract (de token contract). Di token fit for example get di function to fit transfer token or check am for im total supply.

If everibodi do dem own token contract wit diffrent behaviour and di naming convention e go make am hard make pipu fit build contrt or app wey fit relate wit each oda.

Di ethereum communiti don do token standard wey talk how dev fit do token wey anybodi fit operate with oda contrats, products and dem services. Contracts wey dem do unda dis standard need make e get some kind function and events.

Di one wey we sabi pass na ERC20 wey be fungible token and ERC721 wey no be fungible token. In this course, we will learn how to create and interact with NFTs, tokens created with the ERC721 token standard.

If you wan know plenti on top NFTs and ERC721 token standard go look am for Learneth NFT im course.

Di ERC777 na fungible token standard like di ERC20 wey contain plenty beta feature like hooks wey remain for back dey compatible wit ERC20. Go sabi plenti of ERC777 for <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777" target="_blank">EIP (Ethereum improvement im proposal)</a>.

The ERC1155 is a multi-token standard that allows a single contract to manage different types of tokens, such as fungible, non-fungible, or semi-fungible tokens.

## ⭐️ Assignment

For this assignment, we will test your knowledge via a short quiz.
Assign the number of the best answer to the variables `question1` (line 5),
`question2` (line 6), `question3` (line 7) in the `Quiz` contract (line 4).

### Question 1:

Why are blockchain-based tokens so revolutionary?

1. Because people can now make investments anonymously.
2. Because they represent ownership in digital assets that can be owned and transferred.
3. Because you can use tokens to make transactions without having to pay taxes.

### Question 2:

Why did the community create token standards?

1. So that the community can control and approve the tokens that are created.
2. In order to restrict the functionality of tokens to safe and non-malicious actions.
3. So that the community can create tokens that are interoperable with other contracts, products, and services.

### Question 3:

If you would create a decentralised application for a baseball trading card game where each baseball player would be represented by a token, what token standard would you use to write the token contract?

1. ERC20
2. ERC721
