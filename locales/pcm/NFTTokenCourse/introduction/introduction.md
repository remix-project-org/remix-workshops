For dis section of the lesson, we go give you begginer talk on blockchain-based tokens.

Blockchain tokens na new technological building block wey dey created by blockchain technology (like dem websites were for the internet) dat enables a decentralized, ownable internet (web3).

### For start

For de context of web3, tokens mean ownership. Tokens fit represent ownership of anytin: art, reputation, items for video game, shares for company, voting rights, or moni.

De revolutionary innovation of blockchain technologi na say e dey allow data to dey stored outside for way wey no change.
Dis new form of data storage de gree us to keep track of ownership and fit true true get digital items for di first time.

Blockchain Technology dem first do am to keep track of who get bitcoin na decentralized digital money and token wey dey fungible.

### Token wey dey Fungible and non-fungible

Tins like dem money: Bitcoin or one dolla now dey fungible. Fungible means say all assets da di same and e dey interchangeable. Assets like dem art, collectibles, or houses dey non-fungible; dem all dey diffrent and you no fit interchange dem.

We fit divide tokens into two: fungile tokens na where all di tokens an di same and non fungible like dem nfts were all of dem dey unique.

### Di standard of token

De behavior of token dem write am for smart contract (de token contract). Di token fit for example get di function to fit transfer token or check am for im total supply.

If everybody go create their token contracts wit different kain behaviord name pattern, e go make am hard make people build contract or app wey fit interact with each other.

Di ethereum communiti don do token standard wey talk how dev fit do token wey anybodi fit operate with oda contrats, products and dem services. Contracts wey dem do unda dis standard need make e get some kind function and events.

Di one wey we sabi pass na ERC20 wey be fungible token and ERC721 wey no be fungible token. Dis course we fit learn how to fit create and interact with NFTs, tokens created with di
ERC721 token standard.

If you wan know plenti on top NFTs and ERC721 token standard go look am for Learneth NFT im course.

Di ERC777 na fungible token standard like di ERC20 wey contain plenty beta feature like hooks wey remain for back dey compatible wit ERC20. Go sabi plenti of ERC777 for <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777" target="_blank">EIP (Ethereum improvement im proposal)</a>.

Di ERC1155 na multi-token standard wey dey allow single contract to fit manage different types of tokens, like dem fungible, non-fungible, or semi-fungible tokens.

## Homework

For dis homework we go check your head with small quiz.
Assign di number of di best answer to di variables `question1` (line 5),
`question2` (line 6), `question3` (line 7) for di `Quiz` contract (line 4).

### For question 1:

Why blockchain based tokens dey change everytime?

1. Na say pipi fit come dey invest lowkey.
2. Unto say dem fit represent ownership for digital moni wey dem fit own and transfer.
3. Na say you fit use tokens to fit make transactions wey you no go pay taxes.

### Di Question 2:

Why di community been do token standards?

1. So di community fit control and approve di tokens wey dem create.
2. To fit stop di function of token to dey free from actions wey no dey alright.
3. So di community go fit do token wey dem no fit operate wit oda contract, product and work.

### For question 3:

If you go create app wey dey decentralized for buying and selling of baseball card game wey na baseball player go be for one token, wetin you go think dey write the token contract?

1. ERC20
2. ERC721
