Each component of the Remix IDE performs specific functions:

- Most plugins appear in the **Side Panel**.
- The **Top Bar** allows you to switch between workspaces, login with GitHub, set your themes, and access system settings.
- You can edit code in tabs on the **Main Panel**.
- You can view the results of transactions and other actions performed on the IDE in the **Terminal**.
- You can switch between plugins on the **Icon Panel**.
- The **Status Bar** provides info about your current branch, alerts, and tips.

**TIP: You can make a panel larger (or smaller) by dragging its border.**
